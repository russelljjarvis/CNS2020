		I also used random forest regression to investigate when experimental data inform a classifying statistical model which dimensions explain the most of the observed variance in the feature space. Variance-explained will facilitate the production of a list of improvements to make to our models in order to render models better imitations of real data.
		In this project you can see use of:</li>
		PCA, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
		Random Forest Classification (RFC) using 38 features, and also RFC applied to just 2 features (output from PCA).
		using the RFC "variance-explained" feature. 
		Plotting of a decision boundary. (need to redo). 
		Not done yet, but pending Cross-Validation using looping over many different test/train splits.

						Scientific insight is well-served by the discovery and optimization of 
						abstract models that can reproduce experimental findings. 
						NeuroML (NeuroML.org), a model description language for neuroscience,
						facilitates reproducibility and exchange of such models by providing an 
						implementation-agnostic model description in a modular format. 
						NeuronUnit (neuronunit.scidash.org) evaluates model accuracy by subjecting 
						models to experimental data-driven validation tests, 
						a formalization of the scientific method. 


						A neuron model that perfectly imitated real neuronal electrical behavior 
						in response to any stimulus would not be distinguishable from experiments 
						by any conventional physiological measurement.  
						In order to assess whether existing neuron models approached this standard,
						 we took 972 existing neuron models from NeuroML-DB.org and subjected them 
						 to a standard series of electrophysiological stimuli 
						 (somatic current injection waveforms).  
						 
						 We then extracted analogous 
						 448 stimulus-evoked recordings of real cortical neurons from the 
						 Allen Cell Types database. We applied multiple feature extraction 
						 algorithms on the physiological responses of both model simulations
						  and experimental recordings in order to characterize physiological 
						  behavior with a very high degree of detail spanning hundreds of features.


						After applying dimensionality reduction to this very high dimensional 
						feature space, we show that the real (biological neurons) and simulated 
						(model neurons) recordings are easily and fully discriminated by eye or
						 any reasonable classifier. 
						
						 Consequently, not a single model neuron produced physiological responses
						  that could be confused with a biological neuron. 
						  Was this a defect of the model design (e.g. key mechanisms unaccounted for) 
						  or of model parameterization? We found that if we introduced models that 
						  were revised via optimization the revised models overlapped with the
						   distribution of biological neurons, and were mostly classified as such.
						
						   The remaining post-optimization disagreement between models and biological
							neurons may reflect limitations of model design and can be 
							investigated by probing the key features used by classifiers
							to distinguish these two populations.

							In order illustrate that the optimized models are better
